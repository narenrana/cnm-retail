## Description

The implementation is based on the container shipping domain from the [Domain Driven Design](http://www.amazon.com/Domain-Driven-Design-Tackling-Complexity-Software/dp/0321125215) book by Eric Evans, which was [originally](http://dddsample.sourceforge.net/) implemented in Java but has since been ported to Go. This example is a somewhat stripped down version to demonstrate the use of Go kit. The [original Go application](https://github.com/marcusolsson/goddd) is maintained separately and accompanied by an [AngularJS application](https://github.com/marcusolsson/dddelivery-angularjs) as well as a mock [routing service](https://github.com/marcusolsson/pathfinder).
